<br/>

## ✒️ General Information 
DeValiance is the first website I have ever created from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It is a static website that showcases real games 🎮 I have created, and makes maximum use of all the different things I have learnt in the module. The project also consists of additional pages separated from the main website to learn Bootstrap and JavaScript.


<br/>

**🛈 NOTE:**

This webpage only serves as a redirect page to the <a href='https://mistervaliant.github.io/devaliance/index.html'>main website</a>.

<br/>

## ❤️ Motivation
The main aim of devaliance-redirect is to better understand how to host and maintain websites using FileZilla on another host platform except github-pages.
